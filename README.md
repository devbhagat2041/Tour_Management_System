Tehcnology used to create this project

1.	Front-End technologies:
1.1 HTML:
      The project's front-end relies on HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for the
      structure and layout of the user interface. 

1.2 CSS:
     Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is employed to handle the visual presentation and
     styling of the application. It helps in maintaining a consistent and appealing look
     across all web pages.

1.3 JavaScript:
     JavaScript is a fundamental component in the front-end development of the
     application. It is used to implement interactive elements, handle user events, and
     manage data manipulation on the client-side.

1.4 ReactJS:
     ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows the
     creation of reusable UI components, making the code more maintainable and
     Modular.

1.5 React Router:
     React Router is used for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between
     different views within the application without requiring a page refresh.


2.	Back-End technologies:
2.1 Node.js:
     	     Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime that facilitates server-side development. It
   	     enables the execution of JavaScript code on the server, making it ideal for building
     scalable and fast back-end applications.

2.2 Express.js:
     Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It simplifies
     the process of handling HTTP requests and routing, thus aiding in the creation of
     robust APIs.



3.	Database Management:
3.1 MongoDB: 
    	    MongoDB is a NoSQL database that utilizes a JSON-like document format. It is
    chosen for its flexibility and scalability, making it a suitable choice for managing
    travel-related data.

3.2 Mongoose:
    Mongoose is an Object-Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It
    provides a straightforward way to interact with the database by defining data schemas,
    validating data, and simplifying CRUD operations.

4.	Additional Technology:
4.1 JWT (JSON Web Token):
    	   JWT is used for implementing secure authentication and user session management
    within the application.
